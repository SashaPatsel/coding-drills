# Sass

## What goes in which file???

To this point, you may have noticed that Sass is not too different from CSS. That is indeed true. However, it does help with orgamization and structure. That is why we have such an elaborate class-naming convention and so many files to work in. 

In this section, we'll be working a little in almost every file so you can get a sense of how to use them when your styling with Sass on your own.

- Functions
- Animations
