# Constructors

## Recreate the zombie game using constructor functions

## Prerequisites
Install inquirer.

## Instructions
In this exercise you are given a completed zombie game. Go ahead and run original.js to test it out.

You may notice that over a hundred lines of code are dedicated to defining our weapons and zombies. That's definitely overkill.

Furthermore, if we wanted to add more zombies or weapons to our game, we would have to write a lot more code to define those new objects.

Using the code in prompt.js, redesign this game so that it uses constructor functions. 

You will need to define constructors for zombies and for weapons.

Your game should run exactly the same as the one in original.js does.

It may be helpful for you to leave both prompt.js and original.js open next to one another.
