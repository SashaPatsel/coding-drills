# Coding Drills

This repo contains a series of original coding drills designed to help people enhance their coding skills. 

These drills are also designed to accompany the curriculum of the [Trilogy Ed](https://www.trilogyed.com/) Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp.

## Getting Started

Each folder is named after the topic the exercises within cover. Each folder within a given topic contains its own unique exercise. 

Students are meant to use only the readme and prompt file for each exercise. Once they have finished, they should compare their results against those found in the solved folder.

Teachers using these exercises are encouraged to remove the solved folders from each exercise until their students have completed the prompts.
