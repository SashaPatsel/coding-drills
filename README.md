<h2 align="center">🏁 Getting Started 🏁</h2>

Each folder is named after the topic the exercises within cover. Each folder within a given topic contains its own unique exercises. 

These exercises work best for individuals who have some proficiency in a given topic, and would like to practice through conquering new challenges. In other words, these exercises are best used for refining skills rather than learning them from scratch. 

To learn skills from scratch, please visit resources like [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).

Students are meant to use only the readme and prompt file for each exercise. Once they have finished, they should compare their results against those found in the solved folder.

Teachers using these exercises are encouraged to remove the solved folders from each exercise until their students have completed the prompts. 


<h2 align="center">👩‍💻 What You'll Make 👨‍💻</h2>

These code drills contain a mixture of algorithms and project-based exercises. 

These drills are designed to both refine your thinking as an engineer, and to add to your portfolio. 

You can use the algorithms to pracitce for your next interview,  or make projects you can add to your own portfolio. 

Projects include, but are not limited to:
- An original yelp search engine
- A command line zombie game
- An interactive TV show database
