## Installation

- VS code extensions:   
    - erb
    - In settings: `"emmet.includeLanguages": {"erb": "html"}`
- run `bundle init`
- Use `bundle install` rather than `gem install` to install dependencies to a single project rather than on your device.

## Running the program
- run `rackup` from project root

## Ideas
- Hit reddit API
- Serve up reddit's json to our client
- Store that data
