## Things to improve
- Keep your footer outside of your container
- Apply background to the body so they cover the page.

## Final comments
You were able to get the main takeaways from this assignment: media queries and the grid system. The other stylistic errors can be cleaned up with some time, but you learned the most important lessons from the assignment. Good job!
