## Playoff Math

In a single-elimination tournament—such as the tennis Grand Slam
championships—every losing player is immediately eliminated from the
subsequent rounds of play until a single winner is determined. If such a
tournament starts with n players, determine the following:

(a) What is the total number of matches needed to get a winner? `n-1`
(b) How many rounds are there in such a tournament? `log_2(n)`


if 32:
a. 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 31
b. 5 rounds

if 16:
a. 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15
b. 4 rounds


if 64:
a. 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 63
b. 6 rounds
