# Solution

One bandit is going to be the designated driver.

He first takes another bandit across, then brings the boat back to pick up a villager.

That leaves one bandit and one villager on the far bank. The bandit comes back for another villager to take him across. 

This leaves one villager and one bandit on the original bank. The "driver" first takes the bandit, and finally the last villager.
