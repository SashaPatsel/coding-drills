## Bad at Pouring

### Instructions

You have three cantines of different sizes. One holds 8 litres of water, the next holds 5 and the last holds 3. 

Your goal is to make at least one cantine contain only 4 litres of water.

Your starting point is a completely full 8-litre cantine with the two others being completely empty. 

##### The Rules

1. A cantine cannot contain more water than its capacity.

2. You can only move water by completely filling another cantine OR by completely emptying one into another.
