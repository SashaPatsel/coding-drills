## Color Sorting

### Instructions

Imagine you are given blue and red tiles sorted randomly in a line.

Your job is to make it so that all the blue tiles are together on the left side of this line, and all the red tiles are together on the right side. 

You are allowed only two operations:

1. To check the color of a tile

2. To swap any two tiles

Write an algorithm--a series of steps (no code)--to place all the blue tiles on the left and all the red tiles on the right. Try to make your alogrithm as effiecient as possible. There are multiple solutions to this problem, but some are better than others...

### Example

Suppose the tiles were arranged like this:
r,b,b,b,r,r,r,r,b,r,b,r,b,b,r,r

Your goal is to arrange them like this:
b,b,b,b,b,b,b,r,r,r,r,r,r,r,r,r,
