## Baby Counting

### Instructions

How do most babies count? Usually, they use their fingers when they first learn. 

Imagine a baby is counting in the following way: she starts on her thumb with the number 1, then her index finger with 2, her middle with 3, her ring finger with 4, pinky with 5, ring again with 6, middle again with 7, index again with 8, and then we start back with the thumb at 9. 

Imagine that baby counts all the way up to 1000 counting in this same way the whole time. `Which finger would she end on when she reaches 1000?`
