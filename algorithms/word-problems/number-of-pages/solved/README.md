## Our goal is 1578

The most important thing to consider is the different amount of digits within a given range of numbers. We will perform different math on 1-9 than we will on 10-99, then we will from 100-999 etc...

GOAL = 1578

1 through 9 = `9 digits`
+ (10 through 99) * 2 (because there are two digits per page) = `180 digits`

= `189 digits` (we are adding the single digit pages and the double digit pages)

##### Now it's time to dive into the triple digits

To start, we can subtract the digits we already calculated from the total sum. We must also keep in mind that we've already accounted for 100 pages.

1578 - 189 = `1389 digits left to account for` 

1389/3 (because triple digits in 100s) = `463 pages`

463 + 99 = `562 pages`

_Answer = 562_
