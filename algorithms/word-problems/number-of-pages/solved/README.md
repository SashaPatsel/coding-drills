GOAL = 1578

1 - 9 = `9`
+ (10 - 99) * 2 = `180`

= `189`

1578 - 189 = `1389`

1389/3 (because triple digits in 100s) = `463`

463 + 99 = `562`

_Answer = 562_ 

The most important thing to consider is the different amount of digits within a given range of numbers. We will perform different math on 1-9 than we will on 10-99, then we will from 100-999 etc...
