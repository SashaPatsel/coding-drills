## How many pages?

### Instructions

`Determine how many pages are in a book given a number indicative of the sum of all the digits from every page number`.

For every page, we add the number of digits that that page number is comprised of. 

For example, on page 382 we add three digits to our tally. On page 4, we add one digit to our tally. So for pages 1 through 9, we have a total of 9 digits. If we add page ten though, there are 11 total digits, given that ten is comprised of two (1 and 0).

Figure out the amount of pages it would take for the sum of their digits to add up to `1,578`.

Assume the book starts at page 1 and does not skip any numbers
