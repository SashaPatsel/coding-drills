## Count the pairs

## Instructions
Given an array of elements, return the amount of pairs. A pair is defined as two matching elements. 

A third matching element is not counted as part of a pair. 

There can be multiple pairs of a given element.

## Example
Given [1,2,1,3,2,4,2,3,3,1,3,3], your algorithm should output 4. There is one pair of 1s, one pair of 2s, and two pairs of 3s. 

For example, even though there are five 3s, there are only two pairs. 

## Optimal Time
