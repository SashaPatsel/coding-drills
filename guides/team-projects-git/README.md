### Introduction
Github can be at times an incredibly useful tool, at other times, it can be very frustrating--especially when collaborating on the same repo with others.

In this guide, we'll be covering topics from the basics of working with git in teams, to best practices that can help you use github seamlessly.

Without further ado, let's start from the top.

2. ### Setting Up
Before we write any code, every person in your group should have access to the same project. 

- Create a new repo for your project if you haven't already. We will only need to create this project on one person's github. Delegate one member to host the group's project on their github.

- Once the repo is created, visit the main page for the new repository. Towards the top of the page, you'll find a tab called `settings`. Click on settings.

- Towards the left of the screen, after you've hit settings, you'll see a tab `collaborators`. Click on it.

- Once you've clicked on the `collaborators` tab, you'll see an input. Enter all of your team members github usernames, full names or email address into this input one at a time. This should send each member in your group an email invite.
