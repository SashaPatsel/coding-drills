### Channels
Channels are the main source of group communication in Slack. There are two kinds: privaet and public.

#### Public channels
Public Channels are indicated by the `#` symbol. You will find them on the navbar located on the left-hand side of Slack (both online and on the desktop app). As inidicated by the name, everyone in your slack workspace will be able to see messages in these channels. 

Each channel will have its own name. In general, this name will be indicative of the content you will find in this channel. For example, in a channel called "general" you may post, well, general information or announcements. Things that aren't specific to a given topic, but still need to be shared nonetheless. In contrast, a "random" channel will have messages that are random--messages that may not even pertain to the project/organization your Slack team was created for. 

#### Private channels
Private channels are indicated by a sealed padlock to the left of their name. In terms of functionality, they can be used in just the same way as public channels. 

The key difference is that private channels contain a subset of the entire slack workspace members. They are private to only the users that have been invited to that channel. Public channels narrow the entire slack workspace to a specific topic. Private channels do the same, but they limit the amount of people in your workspace who can access the messages for that topic.

#### Joining channels
When you join a slack workspace, you may not be a part of all of its channels, even the public ones. Joining those public channels is very easy though! 

Click on the word `Channels` above where you see all the channels. There you will be able to search for channels by name. 

For example, if you heard some of your classmates discussing the "resources" channel, but you don't see it on your own slack, click on the word channels in your left-hand-side navbar. Type "resources" into the search bar. It will eventually pop up in the suggestes channels as you type. Click on it, and you should be able to join the channel.

### Direct Messages 
Direct messages are an alternative way to communicate on slack. Rather than messaging or reading messages from several people, perhaps you want to message one person, or just a handful of people. direct messages are the best way to do this. direct messages are viewable only to the people who have been messaged. If I send a direct message to Bob, only Bob and I can see that particular message history. 

To send a direct message, click on the `+` sybmol found inside of a small circle next to the words `Direct Messages`. This will also be found in the navbar on the left-hand-side. 

### Threads
Channels and direct messages can easily become cluttered, especially with larger slack teams.
