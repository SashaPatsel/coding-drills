## Compressor

Your job in this algorithm is to create a function which will return a compressed string.

### Example 

Given the string "hhhkkkkkkttttttttt", our function should return h3k6t9.

- h3 because there are 3 "h"s in the string
- k6 because there are 6 "k"s in the string
- t9 because there are 9 "t"s in the string

Note: the characters do not have to be in order. The string "hrkjqehvewqjhvheqvwjcgfwegiuf" should return "h4r1k1j3q3e4v3w3c1g2f2i1u1"

### Instructions
Create a function which takes a string as an argument.
