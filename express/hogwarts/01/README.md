## Overview

In this four part exercise, we'll be creating a Hogwarts app. You will be sending new students to Hogwarts and help them pass their O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels).

On one page, a user can add a new student and place them in a house.

On the main page, the user can click on one student at a time and then click on a class.Â Once the student has gotten all the classes, they have passed their owls, and will no longer appear on the page.

## Instructions

In part one, your job is to serve up static HTML pages. You are given a completely blank server.js ðŸ˜±.

At the root route, serve up index.html. At /add, serve up add.html. 

Note that the above HTMl files may be found in the `public` folder.

When you can hit both HTML pages, on their respective routes, please proceed to 02.
