// Follow the pseudocode step-by-step as detailed below. It may help to think of this problem with a specific example in mind. Try imagining that we are given the number 3.
function spiralist(n) {
  //1. Create an empty array that contains all the sub arrays. This is what we will ultimately return.

}

console.log(0, spiralist(0))

console.log(1, spiralist(1))

console.log(2, spiralist(2))

console.log(3, spiralist(3))

console.log(9, spiralist(9))
